# IdleR-API
API for creating incremental/idle games using JavaFX

This API streamlines the process of making incremental, or idle, games.
Incremental games are, in essence, resource management simulators.
They are complex to code but simple to play.
Typically, they involve setting up a series of resource generators and managing them as they slowly build up resources over time.
Famous examples include Cookie Clicker and Universal Paperclips.

With this API, you can build a basic idle game just by defining the resources and conversion factors.
The code takes care of tracking resource values and formatting the GUI.
In addition, the classes and methods are robust enough that if you wanted to make a more complex game (featuring upgrades, special timed events, etc.), you could.

For a more in depth description of the classes and methods in this API, see the docx file [IdleR_API readme.docx] in this repository.
